Welcome to 3824's Scouting App.

## How to contribute


### Git
Git is a distributed version control system. Think of it as a backup system on steroids. It uses the convept of repositories, branches, and commits to keep track of the history of a collection of files.

#### Git Workflow
At this time, we are planning to use a branch/pull request workflow. There is a nice guide to the flow [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

Short version: When implementing a new feature (e.g. Note Filter) you should create a branch off origin/dev. Once you have implemented the new feature on the branch, you should create a pull request to origin/dev. At this point, the code will enter an informal review process in which it will be tested prior to merging.

Note: origin/dev and origin/master are protected and nothing should be directly changed on them.
